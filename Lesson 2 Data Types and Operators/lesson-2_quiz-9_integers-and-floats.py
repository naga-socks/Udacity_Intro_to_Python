SOLUTION
Traceback means "What was the programming doing
when it broke"! This part is usually less helpful
than the very last line of your error. Though you
can dig through the rest of the error, looking at
just the final line ZeroDivisionError, and the
message says we divided by zero. Python is
enforcing the rules of arithmetic!

In general, there are two types of errors to look
out for

- Exceptions
- Syntax

An Exception is a problem that occurs when the
code is running, but a 'Syntax Error' is a
problem detected when Python checks the code
before it runs it.
